For each target anchor $x$<sub>$t$</sub><sup>$i$</sup> with a pseudo-label $\hat{y}$<sub>$t$</sub><sup>$i$</sup> in a mini-batch, loss $L$<sub>$CDC$</sub><sup>$t,i$</sup> is calculated using the above formula.
- $Z$<sub>$t$</sub><sup>$i$</sup> represents the flattened representation of the target anchor obtained from encoder + projection network.
- $Ï„$ is the temperature hyper-parameter
- $P$<sub>$s$</sub>($\hat{y}$<sub>$t$</sub><sup>$i$</sup>) is the set of positive samples, i.e. samples from source domain with same label as the pseudo label of target anchor.
- $Z$<sub>$s$</sub><sup>$p$</sup> reppresents the flattened representation of a positive sample from source domain obtained from encoder + projection network
- $I$<sub>$s$</sub> is the set of all samples whether positive or negative in the mini-batch.
- The encircled formula shown below represents the Cosine-Similarity between the flattened vectors in both numerator and denominator.<br>
